## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Variables
- BEM


### What I learned
1. When using Google Fonts in an HTML file, if I’m working with font variables, there’s no need to use the classes provided by Google Fonts.
2. Since the default font size for this project is 14px, I set the root font size to 10px using a percentage to simplify converting pixel values to rem.
3. I used BEM for the first time in this project. Since it was small and relatively simple, I took the opportunity to learn this methodology. Initially, I found it verbose, but it made the code much easier to read. I now plan to learn more about it and apply it to future projects.
